2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net alu_obj/auto/slowClockEdge/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin alu_obj/auto/slowClockEdge/led_reg[16]_i_2/O, cell alu_obj/auto/slowClockEdge/led_reg[16]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net alu_obj/auto/slowClockEdge/E[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin alu_obj/auto/slowClockEdge/led_reg[17]_i_2/O, cell alu_obj/auto/slowClockEdge/led_reg[17]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net alu_obj/led_reg[23]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin alu_obj/led_reg[23]_i_1/O, cell alu_obj/led_reg[23]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net alu_obj/manual/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin alu_obj/manual/led_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell alu_obj/manual/led_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net alu_obj/manual/E[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin alu_obj/manual/led_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell alu_obj/manual/led_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-3#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus io_button[4:0] are not locked:  io_button[4]
Related violations: <none>
